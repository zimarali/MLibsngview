Your name is <span>{{mlInput.name}}</span> and you're <span>{{mlInput.adj1}}</span>. Occasionally you like to <span>{{mlInput.verb1}}</span>, that's cool I guess.
We all know you tend to describe yourself as <span>{{mlInput.adj2}}</span>, ok then. Sometimes we'll find you at <span>{{mlInput.place}}</span>, that's weird don't you think?

You should probably start <span>{{mlInput.verb2}}</span> if you ever want a chance at being a <span>{{mlInput.noun2}}</span>.
